<p>If you ever working in a distributed Team, even the team is called as 'Agile Team', It would be quite difficult to hold efficient meetings which have to communicate through IM tools such as Skype. Constantly loosing time is quite annoy, but it seems not too much you can do. However, as our experiences, there's still some practises that can make it more efficient. Maybe you can have a try.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #808000;">Our practice experiences are :</span></em></strong></p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Remove Unnecessary Meetings</strong></span></h4>
<p><em>Whether it is a high efficient team can be judged by the Meetings. If there's always a lot of Meetings and each meeting cost a lot of time. You know how things is going on.</em></p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Release Unessential People </strong></span></h4>
<p><em>More people, more chaos. And only essential people will try to save time instead of waste it. But usually we always invite too many people who shouldn't be there. Keep participate group smaller is the most import practise you should try.</em></p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Prepare Meeting Related Stuff Earlier</span></strong></h4>
<p><em>Is there a published Agenda for everyone ? Is the Meeting Room booked ? Do we need prepare any tool, such as cards, computer or projector ? Do we need print any document, such as specification ? ... The more you prepared, the meeting is more smooth.</em></p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Meeting's Time Must be Limited</strong></span></h4>
<p><em>Usually one hour is the most, some people can't keep attention any longer. We prefer to do more small meetings than just one big monster.</em></p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Video Meeting is the Best</strong></span></h4>
<p><em>Of course, it would be more easy to communicate with others than blinded.</em></p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Need Some Kind of Ceremony </strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Specify a Host</strong></span></p>
<p><em> Free discussion leads to chaos, and if without video at the same time would be a  disaster. If you don't clearly specify the <strong>Host</strong> for the meeting, people will be confused should listen to whom when chaos happened.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Following some kind of process</strong></span></p>
<p><em>The job for <strong>Host</strong> in fact is quite easy, usually he only has to say several simple sentences. Take Estimation Meeting for example, the host may talking about :</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Let's start the Estimation Meeting for Sprint ... "</em></li>
<li><em>"Today we are going to estimation following stories ... "</em></li>
<li><em>"We are estimating story XXX right now, please let PO describe the requirements first  ... "</em></li>
<li><em>"Is the team already clear about the requirements? Do we have any questions for PO? "</em></li>
<li><em>"Ok, if there's no more question for PO, let's estimate !" </em></li>
<li>"<em>Ah, the estimated  story points are quite different, shall we talk about it ? ..."</em></li>
<li><em>"Let's go to next story , the id is ... "</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Making clear of the responsibility</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who should update <strong>VERSION ONE</strong> for the changes</em></li>
<li><em>Who should make notes </em></li>
<li><em>... ...</em></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Improving Communication Language</span></strong></h4>
<p><em>The meeting can only be successful when people join <em>actively</em>. Thus the most most most important thing is always : <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BRAVE TO TALK!!</strong></span>  However, when using a foreign language, such as English, would always be difficult for some people. </em></p>
<p><em>This Achilles heel will finally kills you, and you can never bypass it. It's also hard to improve for a whole Team. But we are already trying some practices right now, hoping can share some day when we succeed.</em></p>
