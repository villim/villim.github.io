<p>Using <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Tomboy</strong></span> as a simple Note tool already for a while,  I quite liked it not long ago.</p>
<p>But when I found it is written by C# ... -_-||  and recently it didn't work that well .  First, my Windows XP is replaced by  Windows7 in office;  Second, Macbook Pro replaced Ubuntu Notebook at home. Some  unexpected things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>In windos7 , didn't support dotnet sdk 4.0, have to downgrade to 3.5 to make it work</em></li>
<li><em>Ubuntu One remove web interface to manage notes, quite inconvenient</em></li>
<li><em>written in C#, need install Mono first on Mac OX or Linux, I hate that</em></li>
<li><em>Mobile version developing very slowly, still not able edit on Mobile</em></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then , I didn't spend too many time to decide to switch to <span style="color: #993300;"><strong>EverNote</strong></span> :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>It's Mature and Powerful</em></li>
<li><em>Support Web, OX,ISO, Windows, Android ...  However, not Linux.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But, there are a few alternative solution when using in Ubuntu (or Linux):</p>
<p><strong>1. Just using the Web UI. (strong recommend)</strong></p>
<p><em>Unlike the old Ubuntu One, EverNote's Web UI is very powerful, almost provide all function and is quite quick.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Install Windows version in wine</strong></p>
<p><em>Could be a little slowly. But mainly , I don't like to use wine to install such kind of frequently used tool.</em></p>
<p><strong>3. Install NixNote</strong></p>
<p><em>NixNote is not developed by EverNote, but can synchronize with EverNote. KDE style , not elegant and a little slow.</em></p>
<pre class="brush:shell">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:vincent-c/nevernote
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nixnoet</pre>
