title: Review PRAGMATIC THINKING AND LEARNING
layout: post
---

开始读这本《Pragmatic Thinking and Learning》前半段的时候，并没有太吸引人，还是引用了好些颇能开眼界的概念和观点，总结的还不错，只是大都从其他地方了解过了。

不过，到了有实操性的 Debug your Mind 开始，即便是似曾相似的观点，也会变得意思起来。

这本书主要是说，我们平时，都是 L-Mode 的思考方式，即使说我们更关注 Verbal，Analytic，Symbolic，Abstract，Temporal，Rational，Digital，Logical，Linear。如果我们永远只是从这个方式来学习，割裂我们大脑的高级功能，我们因该掌握 R-Mode,它给我们带来了，Non-verbal,Non-rational, Synthetic, Spatial, Concrete, Intuitive, Analogic, Holistic。当我们能处理好这两个模式的和平相处，尽而相互转化，那么我们能获得最大的学习效率。

## Advance Learning Skill

书里的东西还是太多，这里只是总结一下关于如何学习的内容。要做到高阶的有效率的主动学习，有三个问题我们需要解决：

* Better ways to deliberately read and summarize written material 
* Using mind maps to explore and find patterns and relationships * Learning by teaching

### Better ways to deliberately read

简单来说，记住 SQ3R 方法。

This technique of studying a book or other printed matter is known as SQ3R; that’s an acronym for the steps you need to take.
* Survey  : Scan the table of contents and chapter summaries for an overview.* Question: Note any questions you have.* Read    : Read in its entirety.* Recite  : Summarize, take notes, and put in your own words.* Review  : Reread, expand notes, and discuss with colleagues.
 
其实就是之前我们说的，读书和打仗差不多，先得有“地图”，然后带着问题去学习，并做好归纳，总结和回顾。但是要注意回顾时的时间安排。

For example, you might plan on retesting yourself along a 2-2- 2-6 schedule: retest after two hours, two days, two weeks, and six months.

 
### Using mind maps

显而易见，不需要多解释了。

### Learning by teaching

依然显而易见，只是提一下“小黄鸭”方式，再尝试找他人帮忙之前，不妨对”小黄鸭“讲解一下，自己遇到的问题。当然，学习新东西也可以找”小黄鸭“帮忙。

## Inner Game

Inner Game是一个新鲜的提法，它教我们，要找到正确的关注点。找对了关注点，就能快速地学习了。

The inner game theory has the solution: instead of issuing a stream of instructions to the student, the idea is to teach the student awareness and to use that awareness to correct their performance. Awareness is an important tool in becoming more than a novice.

 
This is a key aspect to playing the inner game: don’t focus on cor- recting individual details, but just be aware. Accept what is as a first step, and just be aware of it. Don’t judge, don’t rush in with a solution, don’t criticize.
