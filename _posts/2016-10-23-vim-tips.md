This is a memory notes, will be continuous updating ...


## 1. Use Registers

Unlike a single clipboard for Operating System. Vim provide multiple **Registers** for delete, yank and put commands.

Registers are named with character, name can be **0-1** or **a-z**. And we can use OS System Register, 「 + 」 for Linux and MacOS, 「 * 」 for windows.

### 1.1 Normal Register

```
"ayy ( copy current line into register a )
"Ayy ( append to register a by using capital letter ) 
"ay3y ( yank 3 lines to register a )
v"ay ( v: enter visual mode and select lines )
<C-v>"ay ( ctrl-v: enter visual mode and select selection )

"ap ( paste from register a )
<C-r>0 ( Insert Mode, paste from register 0 )

:reg "0 ( display register content )
```

### 1.2 System Clipboard

```
gg"+yG  (gg: go to first character, G: go to the end of the file )
:%y+ ( %: refer to work on all lines )
:%w !pbcopy ( copy the whole file in MacOS )

"+p ( paste from system register, windows should replace + with * )
:r !pbpaste ( past from the clipboard in MacOS )
```

BTW, copy whole file, no need use Vim, there are alot of ways ... ```cat {file} | pbcopy```



## 2. Use Buffers

Buffers in Vim is an in-memory representation of files. 

![List All Buffers](http://villim.github.io/img/2023/vim-buffers-list.png)

```
 :buffers ( list all buffers )
 :ls ( list all buffers )
 :b3 ( switch buffer with numbers )
 :bnext ( swith to next buffer )
 :bdelete 3 ( delete one buffer with number )
 :2,5 bdelete ( delete buffers from 2 to 5 )
```

We can use: [MiniBufExpl](https://github.com/fholgado/minibufexpl.vim)

![MiniBufExpl](http://villim.github.io/img/2023/vim-buffers-MiniBufExpl.png)

While listing all buffers, Vim using **#** to indicate current buffers, with MiniBufExpl we can see all buffers and current buffer at the top.

## 3. Use Windows 

Vim always started with one single window, we can divide it horizaontally or vertically to multiple small windows.

```
<C-w>s ( split horizaontally )
:split ( split horizaontally )

<C-w>v ( split vertically )
:vsplit ( split vertically )

<C-w>w ( switch in cycle between open windows )
<C-w>h ( focus the window to the left )
<C-w>j ( focus the window below )
<C-w>k ( focus the window above )
<C-w>l ( focus the window to the right )

:qa ( quit all windows )
:qa! ( quit all windows without saving )
```

## 4. Vim Search

```
:set hlsearch ( enable high light search result )
:set nohlsearch ( disable high light search result )
:set ignorecase ( case insensitive )

/search-text ( search search-text forward from current position )
?search-text ( search search-text backward from current position )
* ( search the word under the cursor )

/text1\|text2 ( search text1 or text2, the pipe has to be escaped )
/^text1.*text2.*text2/ ( search text1 and text2 and text3, which text1 is the start of line )

/\v"[^"]+" ( search any string inside quotes )

n ( after get searched results, use n to jump to next match )
N ( after get searched results, use n to jump to previous match )
<C-o> ( jump backward in the range of jump locations: that have checked with n/N )
<C-i> ( jump forward in the range of jump locations: that have checked with n/N )

:%s/search-text1/replace-with-text2/  ( search whole file and replace )
:%s/search-text1/replace-with-text2/c ( search whole file and replace, confirm each replace )
```

## 5. Delete Lines with Pattern

```
:g/pattern/d  ( delete all lines that contain a pattern )
:g!/pattern/d  ( delete all lines that do not contain a pattern )
```

The **:global** command allows us to run an Ex command on each line that matches a particular pattern. 

## 6. Save to Nonexistent Directories

```
:!mkdir -p %:h
```

* The **-p flag** is mkdir's parameter, it means to create intermediate directories. 
* **:h**	means Head of the file name (the last component and any separators removed). In this line,  **:h** will removes the filename while preserving the rest of the path
		

## 7. Save as the Root User

When we forgot to open file with sudo command, no need re-edit file again.

```
:w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
```

* The symbol **%** has special meaning on Vim’s command line, it expands to represent the path of the current buffer.
* The **tee** command copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more files.  The output is unbuffered.


## 8. HTML Releated

```
di<  ( delete characters inside, could change d to yank, change too )
vit ( select character of the tag, could change v to delete, yank too )
```
