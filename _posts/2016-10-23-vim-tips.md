## delete multiple lines
```
:g/pattern/d  #  delete all lines that contain a pattern
:g!/pattern/d  #  delete all lines that do not contain a pattern
```
The **:global** command allows us to run an Ex command on each line that matches a particular pattern. 

## Save Files to Nonexistent Directories
```
:!mkdir -p %:h
```

1. The **-p flag** is mkdir's parameter, it means to create intermediate directories. 
2. **:h**	means Head of the file name (the last component and any separators removed). In this line,  **:h** will removes the filename while preserving the rest of the path
		

## Save a File as the Super User
```
:w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
```
The **% symbol** has special meaning on Vimâ€™s command line: it expands to represent the path of the current buffer.


## Traverse the Jump List 
```
The <C-o> and <C-i> 
```

<C-o> command is like the back button, while the complementary <C-i> command is like the forward button.  We can use them to traverse Vim's jump list.


## Using Registers

Register named with character. Name can be **0-1** and **a-z**. And we have speical name, for example for system register ***** or **+** 

### Copy current line into **register a** :

```
"ayy
```

In fact, you can try all the possible COPY command with register, here just using COPY LINE for example.

### Append to **register a** by using  capital letter

```
"Ayy
```

### Paste from **register a** in VIM

```
"ap
```

### System Register

If you want to using gloable system register, **"+"** for Linux, **"*"** for windows.
