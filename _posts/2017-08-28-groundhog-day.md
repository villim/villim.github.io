Happened to see a recommended film list by BBC the other day, [The 100 greatest comedies of all time](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170821-the-100-greatest-comedies-of-all-time). When I saw GROUNDHOG DAY, just can't help to watch it again after 5 years later. It is like there's something important I need to dig out. And It is.

When Phil find that he was trapped in the Groundhog day.  He is asking, Why he couldn't I get that pretty good day that with his girlfreind on the beach over and over and over? But this boring, unimpassioned groundhog reporting day. You can see it's just like talking about our life, and what would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered ? But no one have the answer for this question, and that's also the reason we leading to different lifes. 
 
What Phil have been though, he felt anxious at the beginning, he want to find a way out, Unfortunately, there's no way. Then after panic, he get used to it. He became a「Glass is half full」people, he trying to get benifit from a bad situation, he trying to make a profit with his great advantage that can always try again. He is able to hook up any girls he want, break any laws, even rob bank. Until he find he love Rita, and when he trying to cheating in love, he failed again and again and again ... and he got despaired. He find there's no meaning for this eternal life looping again and again. Then he choose to kill himself, with all the ways of suicide ... I guess the reason he stoped is caused by he feel tired to do it anymore.

After suicide, he start to look at things in different way. He become to notice tiny things in life. he begin to search for beautiful stuff in life. Spent time on reading, learning ice sculpture, playing piano. Life become reasonable even it's looping over again and again. And by accidental, we find a old man have to die on that day, no matter what he could do, he can't safe him. He realise what he want to do, he start to learning all kind of stuff, such as medicine, and try to help anyone he encountered. By doing all these, he found a better self and the love of Rita at the end, and finnialy breaking the loop.

What a enviable life it is. Have the ability to learning by trial-and-error. But we don't have that, what we can do is try to practise more before we get to it. And lucky we can also gain experiences from other people's life. We don't have to go throught the whole processed, why can't we just start our life from improving ourselves and helping others. 

There's still a man standing in my Futune, a Goal in my mind, and that guy is totally different with who I am now.   As I can't relive my life, what the best I can do is to pretend to be him from now.

...

**Despite those titles, power, and pelf,** <br>
**The wretch, concentred all in self,**<br>
**Living, shall forfeit fair renown,**<br>
**And, doubly dying, shall go down** <br>
**To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,** <br>
**Unwept, unhonor’d, and unsung.** 」
