Happened to see a recommended film list by BBC the other day, [The 100 greatest comedies of all time](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170821-the-100-greatest-comedies-of-all-time). When I saw GROUNDHOG DAY, just can't help to watch it again after 5 years later. It is like there's something important I need to dig out. And It is.

About the movie, when Phil find that he was trapped in the Groundhog day. He is asking, Why he couldn't I get his pretty good day that with his girlfreind on the beach over and over and over? But this boring, unimpassioned groundhog reporting day. You can see it's just like talking about our life, and what would you do if you were stucked in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered ? But no one have the answer for this question, and that's also the reason we leading to different lifes. 
 
What Phil have been though, he felt anxious at the beginning, he want to find a way out, Unfortunately, there's no way. Then after panic, he get used to it. He became a GLASS IS HALF FULL people, he trying to get benifit from a bad situation, he trying to make a profit with his great advantage that can always try again. He is able to hook up any girls he want, break laws, even rob bank. Until he found out he love Rita, and after he's trying to cheating in love, failed again and again and again ... then he got despaired. He found there's no meaning for this looping eternal life. He choose to kill himself at the end, with all the ways of suicide ... However, he stoped suicide, I guess is caused by tired to do it anymore.

After suicide period, he start to looking at things in different way. He become to notice tiny things and search for beautiful stuff in life. Spent time on reading, learning ice sculpture, playing piano ... Life become meaningful even it's still looping. And by accidental, we helped a old man who have to die on that day, no matter what he could do, he couldn't safe him. He realised what life is at the end and what he want to do, he start to learning all kind of stuff, such as medicine, and try to help anyone he encountered. By doing all these, he found a better self and the love of Rita at the end, and finnialy breaking the looping life.

What a enviable life it is. Have the ability to learning by trial-and-error. But we don't have that chance, what we can do is try to practise more before we get to stuff. And lucky we can also gain experiences from other people's life. We don't have to go throught the whole processed including bad things, why can't we just start our life from improving ourselves and helping others. 

There's still a man standing in my Futune, a Goal in my mind, and that guy is totally different with who I am now.   As I can't relive my life, what the best I can do is to pretend to be him from now.

...

**Despite those titles, power, and pelf,** <br>
**The wretch, concentred all in self,**<br>
**Living, shall forfeit fair renown,**<br>
**And, doubly dying, shall go down** <br>
**To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,** <br>
**Unwept, unhonor’d, and unsung.** 」
