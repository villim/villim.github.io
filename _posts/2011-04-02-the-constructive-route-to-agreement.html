<p>When you wanna make a agreement with partners, what can you do ? Here's some suggestions for you.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>1. Listen Actively</strong></span></h3>
<p>Show them you understand :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>that they feel strongly</strong></li>
<li><strong>What they feel strongly about</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why they feel strongly about itÂ  (pause to let them response)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>2. Win yourself a hearing</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explain your own feelings (facts by facts)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Refer back to their points</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make your points firmly, but stay friendly</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>3. Work to a joint solution</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seek their ideas</strong></li>
<li><strong>Build on their ideas</strong></li>
<li><strong>Offer you ideas (don't push them)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Construct the solution from everyone's needs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
