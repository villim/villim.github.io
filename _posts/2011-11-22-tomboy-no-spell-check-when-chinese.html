<p>Tomboy is one of my favorite tool. I start to use it when using Ubuntu 8.10.</p>
<p>And when integrated with Ubuntu web Notes service, it became much more powerful. And right now,  I already using it every where : Ubuntu , Windows , Android Phone ...</p>
<p>But the Spell Check function is quite annoying for me, cause when I typing Chinese, it always has ugly underline in red. Quite stupid !!~ Just like following picture:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="tomboy with spell check for Chinese" src="assets/6387705845_2d881c6bf9.jpg" alt="" width="455" height="238" /></p>
<p>Of course, I don't want to totally disable Spell Check function, it is still quite useful when typing English.</p>
<p>Then I decide to create a plugin to disable Spell Check when input Chinese. After researching the source code of Tomboy, The first thing shock me is , it's written by C sharp ! ~  I was thinking it should use Python or some thing else, whatever but not Dot Net. ^_^ A popular tool in Linux is written by Dot Net ... ... what can I say ~</p>
<p>However, later I found there's already some one provide similar function, so I didn't have to create all code by myself. But it's still quite interesting to finish it, cause you can learn how to develop Dot Net projects on Ubuntu and also a chance for me to start using <strong><a title="GitHub" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Just like my guessing, it really cost me a few days to make it working on Ubuntu ~ I have to say, it's quite hard to setup developing environment. However, the result at least make me very happy. Let's see the demo :</p>
