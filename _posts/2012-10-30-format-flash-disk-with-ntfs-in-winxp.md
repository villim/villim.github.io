<p><span style="color: #000000;">Compare with USB Disk, I still prefer flash disk.  For flash disk, of course, the size is much less. But in the same time, physical size is much much more smaller too. That makes you very easy to take it any where.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em; color: #000000;">Usually we'd like format flash disk with "<strong>FAT32</strong>", it can be write and read in all kinds of operation system. But the limitation of no more than 2GB / single file, makes it unable to acclimate current high definition times. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In order to make it write and read in OS, Linux and Windows, the best choice is "</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>exFat</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;">".  OS already support exFat from 10.6,  Win7 and Win8 can support it with no doubt. The only trouble is in Windows XP you need install</span>  <strong><a title="KB955704" href="http://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/download/details.aspx?id=19364" target="_blank">KB955704</a></strong>,<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> </strong>but it's quite easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">However, it's a pity my High Definition Player doesn't support exFat, the only choice for me is <strong>NTFS . </strong>At least ,  Linus can support it and OS can read it, write with some tools. </span></p>
<p>I'm using XP at home. In Windows7 , you can easily find "<strong>NTFS</strong>" in " <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Format -&gt; File System</strong></span>" . But how to format in WinXP ?</p>
<ol>
<li>Plugin your flash disk</li>
<li>View <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Properties</span> </strong>of flash disk</li>
<li>Click <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Hardware</span> </strong>in <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Properties</span></strong></li>
<li>Select your flash disk in <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>All disk drivers</strong></span>, click <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Properties</strong> </span>button</li>
<li>Choose <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Policies</strong> </span>tab and select <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Optimize for Performance </strong></span></li>
<li>Now you are able to format flash disk with NTFS</li>
<li>after formatted, it's better to change back to<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Optimize for quick removal </strong></span></li>
</ol>
