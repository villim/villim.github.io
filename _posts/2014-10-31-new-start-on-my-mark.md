Sending more and more colleagues and friends away in the passed few months. 31th Oct. 2014, after working for E.Novation (Chengdu) for 6.5 years, finanlly it comes to the end for me. Company is changing their Chinese bussiness policy, so the software department is dismissed.

Although we can't say it was a happy ending for the administrative problems, but it was true a substantial experience for me. 

When I came back to Chengdu from Shanghai at 2008, the only thing I know is I like programming and communication with people. After these years, I'm glad I still keep this origin.

It's was a pleasnt time for me in E.Novation, I have to say. And these were lots of great people and intresting guys, however, most of them left gradually. But we learnd tons of new stuff.

Agile is the most significant reminded stuff as I remember. Though I already knowed about it in my previous company, but at that time, it was so fresh and we were just doing formal imitation, we didn't really understand it? I do start to use Scrum after joined E.Novation. Gone for trainning and keeping in practicing for these years, try to working with kinds of people and managing working with distributed development teams. I can't say we really find the best way to go, but at least understand WHY and GOAL, and these valuable practice experiences are the real treasure left to me. 

The product I Worked on, is also quite a chanllenge. Most of the techniques, design method are new for me at the beginning. The project was worked by some smart and skilled guru, the conmunication with them is the best gift I've got. The way they thinking and learning, really inspired me. Although I still didn't satisfied with my  tech skills, but I do enhance my confidence of what I can do. 

The happliest team building hours are the best sweety memories. The days we hiking on the mountains is still clear to me. The best thing is there's always those smart guys with broad hobbies in the same camp. 

At last, this year, my wife and I meet our first baby Sean. That changes everything. There's now one more reason for continue fighting. He is also a product we tried to make the world better ^_^

Time to go with no regret. It's not a perfect ending, but not a bad start. However, it's best to rest a while and think all these things through. There's no reason not to seeking for another successful career, on my mark ~
